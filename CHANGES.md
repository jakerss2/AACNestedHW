Mini-project First redo.

I added my name to a couple of files.

There is clutter with files. I think my vscode added those files and then they pop up from time
to time. I have attempted to remove those.

I fixed my code to pass tests. Specifcally the methods in AACMappings. addItem, select, and the constructor.

I got a comment on formatting, but I think I might've submitted then fixed... unsure, but I didn't change the formatting so who knows.

I tried removing all error print messages.
